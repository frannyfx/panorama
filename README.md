# Panorama
## 📖 Description
The **Panorama** project aims to shine light on the amount of work that contributors have carried out on a group project.

## ☕️ Requirements
Panorama has the following requirements:
- Node.js ≥ 13.9.0;
- NPM ≥ 6.14.8;
- A Redis server for its distributed job queue system;
- `typescript` and `webpack-cli` installed as global Node modules.

## ⚙️ Compiling
You should build the frontend component first, as the script will also transfer the necessary files to the compilation directory.

It's worth noting that these instructions assume a  macOS or 🐧 Linux environment, so your mileage may vary.

### Frontend
To compile the frontend using Webpack, which will also take care of compiling the TypeScript code, simply run:

```
npm run build-client
```

Running Webpack in production mode will drastically reduce file size, but may take a long time to complete. To do so, run the following command:
```
npm run build-client-prod
```

### Backend
#### Configuration
Create a new `config.json` file by running:
```
cp src/server/config.default.json src/server/config.json
```

Edit the new config file in your preferred editor to include the client ID and secret for your app.

```
nano src/server/config.json
```

You will also need a valid RSA private key used in Panorama's cryptographic modules. To generate one, run:

```
openssl genrsa -out assets/crypto/key.pem
```

#### Prerequisites
Firstly, install the NPM packages by running:
```
npm install
```

Additionally, if you haven't already, install the required modules globally:
```
npm install -g typescript webpack-cli
```

#### Compiling
Then, compile the TypeScript code using the compiler:

```
npm run build-server
```

Make sure you let `node-gyp` compile `sqlite3` to a native module. If you get an error about this, just run:
```
npm rebuild
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running
The server can be executed by running:

```
node dist/index.js
```
